- Implemented TSL Trust service Status list functionality for BDOC and ASiC-E formats. TSL is used for checking the trustworthiness of trust-services (CA, OCSP, time-stamping services) during signature creation and validation.  The European Commission's (EC) TSL list (https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml) is used for finding the trusted national TSL lists.
	- Certificates of all the EU member states' trust services that are registered in national TSL lists are supported.

	- Implemented changes to "Signature" tab ("Show details" view):
	- BDOC-TS signature's format is displayed as "BES/time-stamp" in the "Signature format" data field. 
	- Added button "Show TSA certificate". The Time-Stamping Authority's certificate is displayed when clicking on the button.
	- Added data fields "TSA time", "TSA time (UTC)", "TSA certificate issuer".
	- The signature creation time of BDOC-TS signature is the time-stamp's creation time (in case of a signature with time-stamp, the OCSP validity confirmation's creation time is the signing time). The value is displayed in "Signed on" field in the main window, "TSA time" field in "Signature" tab ("Show details" view), "Time" field in Validity Confirmation Sheet ("Print Summary" window).

- Fixed problem with M-ID signing in OSX, added check that PKCS#11 driver is called out only when PC/SC process is running. Previously, M-ID signing was occasionally not successful and produced libdigidoc error 16 if there was no ID-card reader connected to the computer during signing.
- Fixed "Send container to e-mail" functionality. Previously, the BDOC or DDOC container was not added as an attachment to the e-mail in OSX platform.
